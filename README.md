# Movie Ratings & Revenues Analysis

This project focused on analyzing the relationship between movie ratings and their global box office revenues. By merging two datasets, one containing information from IMDB and the other with box office collection data, the goal was to explore if higher-rated movies generated more revenue.

## What Was Done

  Two related datasets were gathered using different methods:
  1. **IMDB Movies Dataset**: Manually downloaded from Kaggle (CSV file).

- **Data Cleaning & Merging:**

## Data Details

1. **IMDB Movies Dataset:**  
   Contained movie details such as:

2. **Box Office Dataset:**  
   Included box office collection data, such as:
   - Worldwide, domestic, and foreign box office earnings, along with their respective percentages.

## Analysis

- The goal was to answer a simple question: **Did higher movie ratings correlate with higher box office revenue?**
